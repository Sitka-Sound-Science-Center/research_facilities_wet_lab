This repository outlines the capabilities and design features of the wet lab spaces at the Sitka Sound Science Center. SSSC researchers and our collaborative partners use these spaces to engineer new experiments in our unique location. Please inquire with SSSC research staff if you'd like to learn more or rent one of these spaces.
