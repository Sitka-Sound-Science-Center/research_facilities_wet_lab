This repository outlines the capabilities and design features of the wet lab spaces at the Sitka Sound Science Center. SSSC researchers and our collaborative partners use these spaces to engineer new experiments in our unique location. Please inquire with SSSC research staff if you'd like to learn more or rent one of these spaces.
## Sitka Sounds Science Center Research Facilities - The Sage Wet Lab
The Sitka Sound Science Center is home to 1,500 Sq.ft. of Labratory space with capacity for flow-through water experiments using either raw saltwater from Sitka Sound or/and UV-treated freshwater from Kaasdaa Héen river. Our infastructure allows for experimental designs that mimics or manipulates current water condition in our local/similar region. The newly installed temperature manipulating equipement allows users to increase incoming water temperature by upwards of 15 degrees celsius (ex. an incoming water temperature of 5 ^o^C can reach 20 ^o^C) as well as stablize the water to maintain stead low temperatures with flow-through rates (appoximately 20 gallons per minute) to sustain the lives of salmon, invertebrates, kelp, and other aquatic species.  These labratories also house technical equipment to quantify, dissect, store, and ship experiment subjects and materials.
